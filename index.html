            <p>Hello, my name is Kai. Legally Dakota "Kai" Lyons, but I don't use the name Dakota anymore. I am an exhausted, angry pile of mild chaotic energy. I am a FreeBSD user, <a href="https://potabi.com" target="_blank">Potabi</a> lead developer, libertarian communist, and open-source lover. I am currently taken by my wonderful theyfriend. I have a debit card, of which you can fill up by <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/loralighte" target="_blank">donating to me</a>. A little bit about me. I live in Colorado Springs, CO. I am a polyamorous (not always in poly groups), pansexual, agender/gender apathetic, polyromantic. Those titles just mean: I have no gender (or really don't care in most cases), I am sexually atracted to all genders, I am only romantically atracted to certain genders (Female, FtM Trans, MtF Trans, genderfae, agender, demigirl). If you desperately need more information <a href="https://lgbta.wikia.org" target="_blank">this wiki</a> can help you.</p>
            <p>I like to tell people to fuck off, I have rape-related traumas, and I have been becoming decensitized to nightmares, flashbacks, and most triggers that cause events like panic attacks and anxiety spikes. Not to say they don't happen, just that I recover from them faster than I probably should. That's not a brag, that's not a good thing, that's not even me looking for sympathy, it's to just say I am here to listen if you need to rant, because hon, most shit aint hurting me no more. Send me an email if you need to talk.</p>
            <p>I spend most of my time working on Potabi. I work in the C/C++, Java, V, Shell, and Python programming languages. For web development the languages I use are HTML, CSS, SASS, and MEML. I hate JavaScript with a burning passion. Languages I want to learn are Nim, Zig, and Lua. HTML/CSS frameworks I know and use are Bulma, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript-less Bootstrap.</p>
            <p>The operating systems I use are Pop!_OS, FreeBSD, OpenIndiana, and sometimes even HaikuOS. I use MATE and XFCE. I will never use KDE, stop telling me "how good KDE" is and why "I should love and respect it", fuck off. I love the Lumina desktop too, but I don't use it as much.</p>
            <p>Past mistakes I have made include: Arisblu, Arisred, ArisbluBSD, Ubuntu Lumina Remix, Ubuntu Pantheon Remix, the 3 days I worked on Ubuntu i3 Remix, Keter, MEML (made not-failure by Fushra), Fivnex, and more. I really love operating system development, I am trying to learn how to make compilers, and I really wanna learn how to make a compositor like XORG, with a custom desktop environment on top of it.</p>
